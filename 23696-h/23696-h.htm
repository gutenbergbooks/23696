    <h2>
      I
    </h2>
    <p>
      I had left Sandy MacWhirter crooning over his smouldering wood fire the
      day Boggs blew in with news of the sale of Mac&rsquo;s two pictures at the
      Academy, and his reply to my inquiry regarding his future plans (vaguely
      connected with a certain girl in a steamer chair), &ldquo;By the next steamer,
      my boy,&rdquo; still rang in my ears, but my surprise was none the less genuine
      when I looked up from my easel, two months later, at Sonning-on-the-Thames
      and caught sight of the dear fellow, with Lonnegan by his side, striding
      down the tow-path in search of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the Great Horn Spoon!&rdquo; came the cry. And the next minute his big arms
      were about my shoulders, his cheery laugh filling the summer air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lonnegan&rsquo;s greeting was equally hearty and spontaneous, but it came with
      less noise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been roaring that way ever since we left London,&rdquo; said the
      architect. &ldquo;Ever since we landed, really,&rdquo; and he nodded at Mac. &ldquo;Awfully
      glad to see you, old man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next moment the three of us were flat on the grass telling our
      experiences, the silver sheen of the river flashing between the
      low-branched trees lining the banks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lonnegan&rsquo;s story ran thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      Mac had disappeared the morning after their arrival; had remained away two
      weeks, reappearing again with a grin on his face that had frozen stiff and
      had never relaxed its grip. &ldquo;You can still see it; turn your head, Mac,
      and let the gentleman see your smile.&rdquo; Since that time he had spent his
      nights writing letters, and his days poring aver the morning&rsquo;s mail. &ldquo;Got
      his pocket full of them now, and is so happy he&rsquo;s no sort of use to
      anybody.&rdquo; Mac now got his innings:
    </p>
    <p>
      Lonnegan&rsquo;s airs had been insufferable and his ignorance colossal. What
      time he could spare from his English tailor&mdash;&ldquo;and you just ought to
      see his clothes, and especially his checkerboard waistcoats&rdquo;&mdash;had
      been spent in abusing everything in English art that wasn&rsquo;t three hundred
      years old, and going into raptures over Lincoln Cathedral. The more he saw
      of Lonnegan the more he was convinced that he had missed his calling. He
      might succeed as a floorwalker in a department store, where his airs and
      his tailor-made upholstery would impress the hayseeds from the country,
      but, as for trying to be&mdash;The rest was lost in a gurgle of smothered
      laughter, Lonnegan&rsquo;s thin, white fingers having by this time closed over
      the painter&rsquo;s windpipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      My turn came now:
    </p>
    <p>
      I had been at work a month; had my present quarters at the White Hart Inn,
      within a stone&rsquo;s throw of where we lay sprawled with our faces to the sun&mdash;the
      loveliest inn, by the way, on the Thames, and that was saying a lot&mdash;with
      hand-polished tables, sleeve and trouser-polished arm-chairs, Chippendale
      furniture, barmaids, pewter mugs, old and new ale, tough bread, tender
      mutton, tarts&mdash;gooseberry and otherwise; strawberries&mdash;two would
      fill a teacup&mdash;and <i>roses!</i> Millions of roses! &ldquo;Well, you
      fellows just step up and look at &lsquo;em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And not a place to put your head,&rdquo; said Mac.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Been there,&rdquo; replied Lonnegan. &ldquo;The only decent rooms are reserved for a
      bloated American millionaire who arrives to-day&mdash;everything else
      chock-a-block except two bunks under the roof, full of spiders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mac drew up one of his fat legs, stretched his arms, pushed his slouch hat
      from his forehead&mdash;he was still on his back drinking in the sunshine&mdash;and
      with a yawn cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They ought to be exterminated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The spiders?&rdquo; grumbled Lonnegan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, millionaires. They throw their money away like water; they crowd the
      hotels. Nothing good enough for them. Prices all doubled, everything
      slimed up by the trail of their dirty dollars. And the saddest thing in it
      all to me is that you generally find one or two able-bodied American
      citizens kotowing to them like wooden Chinese mandarins when the great men
      take the air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who, for instance?&rdquo; I asked. No millionaires with any such outfit had
      thus far come my way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lonnegan, for one,&rdquo; answered Mac.
    </p>
    <p>
      The architect raised his head and shot a long, horizontal glance at the
      prostrate form of the painter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Lonnegan, I am sorry to say,&rdquo; continued Mac, his eyes fixed on the
      yellow greens in the swaying tree-tops.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was only polite,&rdquo; protested the architect. &ldquo;Lambert is a client of
      mine; building a stable for him. Very level-headed man is Mr. Samuel
      Lambert; no frills and no swelled head. It was Tommy Wing who was doing
      the mandarin act 32 the other day at the Carlton&mdash;not me. Got dead
      intimate with him on the voyage over and has stuck to him like a plaster
      ever since. Calls him &lsquo;Sam&rsquo; already&mdash;did to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Behind his back or to his face?&rdquo; spluttered Mac, tugging at his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it up,&rdquo; said Lonnegan, pulling his hat over his face to shield his
      eyes from the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mac raised himself to a sitting posture, as if to reply, fumbled in his
      watch-pocket for a match, instead; shook the ashes from his brier-wood,
      filled the bowl with some tobacco from his rubber pouch, drew the lucifer
      across his shoe, waited until the blue smoke mounted skyward and resumed
      his former position. He was too happy mentally&mdash;the girl in the
      steamer chair was responsible&mdash;and too lazy physically to argue with
      anybody. Lonnegan rolled over on his elbows, and feasted his eyes on the
      sweep of the sleepy river, dotted with punts and wherries, its background
      of foliage in silhouette against the morning sky. The Thames was very
      lovely that June, and the trained eye of the distinguished architect
      missed none of its beauty and charm. I picked up my brushes and continued
      work. The spirit of perfect camaraderie makes such silences not only
      possible but enjoyable. It is the restless chatterer that tires.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lonnegan&rsquo;s outbreak had set me to thinking. Lambert I knew only by
      reputation&mdash;-as half the world knew him&mdash;a man of the people:
      lumber boss, mill owner, proprietor of countless acres of virgin forest;
      many times a millionaire. Then came New York and the ice-cream palace with
      the rock-candy columns on the Avenue, and &ldquo;The Samuel Lamberts&rdquo; in the
      society journals. This was all the wife&rsquo;s doings. Poor Maria! She had
      forgotten the day when she washed his red flannel shirts and hung them on
      a line stretched from the door of their log cabin to a giant white pine&mdash;one
      of the founders of their fortune. If Tommy Wing called him &ldquo;Sam&rdquo; it was
      because old &ldquo;Saw Logs,&rdquo; as he was often called, was lonely, and Tommy
      amused him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tommy Wing&mdash;Thomas Bowditch Wing, his card ran&mdash;I had known for
      years. He was basking on the topmost branches now, stretched out in the
      sunshine of social success, swaying to every movement made by his
      padrones. He was a little country squirrel when I first came across him,
      frisking about the root of the tree and glad enough to scamper close to
      the ground. He had climbed a long way since then. All the blossoms and
      tender little buds were at the top, and Tommy was fond of buds, especially
      when they bloomed out into yachts and four-in-hands, country houses,
      winters in Egypt (Tommy an invited guest), house parties on Long Island or
      at Tuxedo, or gala nights at the opera with seats in a first tier.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the ascent he had forgotten his beginnings&mdash;not an unnatural thing
      with Tommies: Son of a wine merchant&mdash;a most respectable man, too;
      then &ldquo;Importer&rdquo; (Tommy altered the sign); elected member of an athletic
      club; always well dressed, always polite;&mdash;invited to a member&rsquo;s
      house to dine; was unobtrusive and careful not to make a break. Asked
      again to fill a place at the table at the last moment-accepted gracefully,
      not offended&mdash;never offended at anything. Was willing to see that the
      young son caught the train, or would meet the daughter at the ferry and
      escort her safely to school. &ldquo;So obliging, so trustworthy,&rdquo; the mother
      said. Soon got to be &ldquo;among those present&rdquo; at the Sherry and Delmonico
      balls. Then came little squibs in the society columns regarding the
      movements of Thomas Bowditch Wing, Esquire. He knew the squibber, and
      often gave her half a column. Was invited to a seat in the coaching
      parade, saw his photograph the next morning in the papers, he sitting next
      to the beautiful Miss Carnevelt. He was pretty near to the top now; only a
      little farther to where the choicest buds were bursting into flower; too
      far up, though, ever to recognize the little fellows he had left frisking
      below. There was no time now to escort school-girls or fill unexpectedly
      empty seats unless they were exclusive ones. His excuse was that he had
      accepted an invitation to the branch above him. The mother of the
      school-girl now, strange to say, instead of being miffed, liked him the
      better, and, for the first time, began to wonder whether she hadn&rsquo;t made
      too free with so important a personage. As a silent apology she begged an
      invitation for a friend to the Bachelor Ball, Tommy being a subscriber and
      entitled to the distribution of a certain number of tickets. Being single
      and available, few outings were given without him&mdash;not only week-ends
      (Weak Odds-and-Ends, Mac always called them), but trips to Washington,
      even to Montreal in the winter. Then came the excursions abroad&mdash;Capri,
      Tangier, Cairo.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on one of these jaunts that he met &ldquo;Saw Logs,&rdquo; who, after sizing
      him up for a day, promptly called him &ldquo;Tommy,&rdquo; an abbreviation instantly
      adopted by Maria&mdash;so fine, you know, to call a fellow &ldquo;Tommy&rdquo; who
      knew everybody and went everywhere. Sometimes she shrieked his name the
      length of the deck. On reaching London it was either the Carlton or the
      Ritz for Lambert. Tommy, however, made a faint demur. &ldquo;Oh, hang the
      expense, Tommy, you are my guest for the summer,&rdquo; broke out Lambert. What
      a prime minister you would have made, Tommy, in some kitchen cabinet!
    </p>
    <p>
      There were no blossoms now out of his reach. Our little squirrel had
      gained the top! To dazzle the wife and daughter with the priceless value
      of his social position and then compel plain, honest, good-natured Samuel
      Lambert to pay his bills, and to pay those bills, too, in such a way, &ldquo;by
      Heavens, sir, as not to wound a gentleman&rsquo;s pride&rdquo;: that, indeed, was an
      accomplishment. Had any other bushy tail of his acquaintance ever climbed
      so high or accomplished so much?
    </p>
    <p>
      A movement on my right cut short my revery.
    </p>
    <p>
      MacWhirter had lifted his big arms above his head, and was now twisting
      his broad back as if for a better fulcrum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lonny&mdash;&rdquo; he cried, bringing his body once more to a sitting posture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mac.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that humiliating and servile interview which you had a short time ago
      with your other genuflector, the landlord of the White Hart Inn, did you
      in any way gain the impression that every ounce of grub in his shebang was
      reserved for the special use of his highness, Count Kerosene, or the Earl
      of Asphalt, or the Duke of Sausage, or whatever the brute calls himself?&mdash;or
      do you think he can be induced to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think what, you obtuse duffer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That he can be induced.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, grab that easel and let us go to luncheon.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      II
    </h2>
    <p>
      I had not exaggerated the charm of the White Hart Inn&mdash;nobody can. I
      know most of the hostelries up and down this part of the river&mdash;the
      &ldquo;Ferry&rdquo; at Cookham, the &ldquo;French Horn&rdquo; across the Backwater, one or two at
      Henley, and a lovely old bungalow of a tavern at Maidenhead; but this
      garden of roses at Sonning has never lost its fascination for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the White Hart is like none of these. It fronts the river, of course,
      as they all do&mdash;you can almost fish out of the coffee-room window of
      the &ldquo;Ferry&rdquo; at Cookham&mdash;and all the life of the boat-houses, the
      punts and wherries, with their sprawling cushions and bunches of
      jack-straw oars, and tows, back and forth, of empty boats, goes on just as
      it does at the other boat-landings, up and down the river; but, at the
      White Hart, it is the rose garden that counts! Planted in rows, like corn,
      their stalks straight as walking-sticks and as big; then a flare of
      smaller stalks like umbrella ribs, the circle covered with Prince Alberts,
      Cloth-of-Golds, Teas, Saffrons, Red Ramblers (the old gardener knows their
      names; I don&rsquo;t). And the perfume that sweeps toward you and the way it
      sinks into your soul! Bury your face in a bunch of them, if you don&rsquo;t
      believe it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the bridge! That mouldy old mass of red brick that makes three clumsy
      jumps before it clears the river, the green rushes growing about its feet.
      And the glory of the bend below, with the fluff of elm, birch and maple
      melting into the morning haze!
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside it is none the less delightful. Awnings, fronting the garden,
      stretch over the flowerbeds; vines twist their necks, the blossoms peeping
      curiously as you take your coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a coffee-room, of course, with stags&rsquo; heads and hunting prints,
      and small tables with old-fashioned flowers in tiny vases, as well as a
      long serving board the width of the room, where everything that can be
      boiled, baked or stewed and then served cold awaits the hungry.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at this long board that we three brought up, and it was not long
      before Lonnegan and Mac were filling their plates, and with their own
      hands, too, with thin cuts of cold roast beef, chicken and slivers of ham,
      picking out the particular bread or toast or muffin they liked best,
      bringing the whole out under the low awning with its screen of roses, the
      swinging blossoms brushing their cheeks&mdash;some of them almost in their
      plates.
    </p>
    <p>
      From where we sat over our boiled and baked&mdash;principally boiled&mdash;we
      could see not only the suite of rooms reserved for the great man and his
      party&mdash;one end of the inn, really, with a separate entrance&mdash;but
      we could see, too, part of the tap-room, with its rows of bottles, and
      could hear the laughter and raillery of the barmaid as she served the
      droppers-in and loungers-about. We caught, as well, the small square hall,
      flanked by the black-oak counter, behind which were banked bottles of
      various shapes and sizes, rows of pewter tankards and the like, the whole
      made comfortable with chairs cushioned in Turkey red, and never empty&mdash;the
      chairs, I mean; the tankards always were, or about to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      This tap-room, I must tell you, is not a bar in the American sense, nor is
      the girl a barkeeper in any sense. It is the open club of the village,
      where everybody is welcome who is decent and agreeable. Even the curate
      drops in&mdash;not for his toddy, perhaps (although &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t generally
      sometimes almost always tell,&rdquo; as Mac said), but for a word with anybody
      who happens to be about. And so does the big man of the village who owns
      the mill, and the gardener from Lord So-and-So&rsquo;s estate, and the lord
      himself, for that matter, the groom taking his &ldquo;bitter&rdquo; from the side
      window, with one eye on his high stepper polished to a piano finish. All
      have a word or a good-morning or a joke with the barmaid. She isn&rsquo;t at all
      the kind of a girl you think she is. Try it some day and you&rsquo;ll discover
      your mistake. It&rsquo;s Miss Nance, or Miss Ellen, or whatever else her parents
      fancied; or Miss Figgins, or Connors, or Pugby&mdash;but it is never Nance
      or Nell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our luncheon over, we joined the circle, the curate making room for
      Lonnegan, Mac stretching his big frame half over a settle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the States, gentlemen, I should judge,&rdquo; said the curate in a cheery
      tone&mdash;an athletic and Oxford-looking curate, his high white collar
      and high black waistcoat gripping a throat and chest that showed oars and
      cricket bats in every muscle. Young, too&mdash;not over forty.
    </p>
    <p>
      I returned the courtesy by pleading guilty, and in extenuation, presented
      my comrades to the entire room, Lonnegan&rsquo;s graceful body straightening to
      a present-arms posture as he grasped the outstretched hand of a brother
      athlete, and Mac&rsquo;s heartiness capturing every one present, including the
      barmaid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then some compounded extracts were passed over the counter and the talk
      drifted as usual (I have never known it otherwise) into comparisons
      between the two &ldquo;Hands Across the Sea&rdquo; people. That an Englishman will
      ever really warm to a Frenchman or a German nobody who knows his race will
      believe, but he can be entirely comfortable (and the well-bred Englishman
      is the shyest man living) with the well-bred American.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lonnegan as chief spokesman, in answer to an inquiry, and with an
      assurance born of mastery of his subject instantly recognized by the
      listeners, enlarged on the last architectural horror, the skyscraper, its
      cost, and on the occupations of the myriads of human bees who were hived
      between its floors, all so different from the more modest office
      structures around the Bank of England: adding that he had the plans of two
      on his drawing table at home, a statement which confirmed the good
      opinions they had formed of his familiarity with the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      I floated in with some comparisons touching upon the technic of the two
      schools of water-color painting, and, finding that the curate had a
      brother who was an R.A., backed out again and rested on my oars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mac, more or less concerned over the expected arrival, and anxious that
      his listeners should not consider the magnate as a fair example of his
      countrymen, launched out upon the absence of all class distinctions at
      home-one man as good as another&mdash;making Presidents out of farmers,
      Senators out of cellar diggers, every man a king&mdash;that sort of thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mac had finished&mdash;and these Englishmen <i>let you finish</i>&mdash;the
      mill-owner, a heavy, red-faced man (out-of-doors exercise, not Burgundy),
      with a gray whisker dabbed high up on each cheek, and a pair of keen,
      merry eyes, threw back the lapels of his velveteen coat (riding-trousers
      to match), and answered slowly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll excuse me, sir, but I stopped a while in the States, and I can&rsquo;t
      agree with you. We take off our caps here to a lord because he is part of
      our national system, but we never bow down to the shillings he keeps in
      his strong box. You do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lists were &ldquo;open&rdquo; now. Mac fought valiantly, the curate helping him
      once in a while; Lonnegan putting in a word for the several professions as
      being always exempt&mdash;brains, not money, counting in their case&mdash;Mac
      winning the first round with:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not all of us, my dear sir; not by a long shot. When any of our people
      turn sycophants, it is you English who have coached them. A lord with you
      is a man who doesn&rsquo;t have to work. So, when any of us come over here to
      play&mdash;and that&rsquo;s what we generally come for&mdash;everybody, to our
      surprise, kotows to us, and we acknowledge the attention by giving a
      shilling to whoever holds out his hand. Now, nobody ever kotows to us at
      home. We&rsquo;d get suspicious right away if they did and shift our wallets to
      the other pocket; not that we are not generous, but we don&rsquo;t like that
      sort of thing. We do here&mdash;that is, some of us do, because it marks
      the difference in rank, and we all, being kings, are tickled to death that
      your flunkies recognize that fact the moment they clap eyes on us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lonnegan looked at Mac curiously. The dear fellow must be talking through
      his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, I got a sudden shock on the steamer on my way home last fall, and
      from an <i>American gentleman</i>, too&mdash;one of the best, if he was in
      tarpaulins&mdash;and I didn&rsquo;t get over it for a week. No kotow about him,
      I tell you. I wanted a newspaper the worst way, and was the first man to
      strike the Sandy Hook pilot as he threw his sea-drenched leg over the
      rail. &lsquo;Got a morning paper?&rsquo; I asked. &lsquo;Yes, in my bag.&rsquo; And he dumped the
      contents on the deck and handed me a paper. I had been away from home a
      year, mostly in England, and hadn&rsquo;t seen anybody, from a curator in a
      museum to the manager of an estate, who wouldn&rsquo;t take a shilling when it
      was offered him, and so from sheer force of habit I dropped a trade dollar
      into his hand. You ought to have seen his face. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s this for?&rsquo; he
      asked. &lsquo;No use to me.&rsquo; And he handed it back. I wanted to go out and kick
      myself full of holes, I was so ashamed. And, after all, it wasn&rsquo;t my
      fault. I learned that from you Englishmen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The toot-toot of an automobile cut short the discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The American millionaire had arrived!
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody now started on the run: landlord, two maids in blue dresses with
      white cap strings flying, three hostlers, two garage men, four dogs, all
      bowing and scraping&mdash;all except the dogs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did I tell you?&rdquo; laughed Mac, tapping the curate&rsquo;s broad chest with
      the end of his plump finger. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way you all do. With us a porter
      would help him out, a hotel clerk assign him a room, and that would end
      it. The next morning the only man to do him reverence would be the waiter
      behind his chair figuring for the extra tip. Look at them. Same old kotow.
      No wonder he thinks himself a duke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The party had disembarked now and were nearing the door of the private
      entrance, the two women in Mother Hubbard veils, the two men in
      steamer-caps and goggles&mdash;the valet and maid carrying the coats and
      parasols. The larger of the two men shed his goggles, changed his
      steamer-cap for a slouch hat which his valet handed him, and disappeared
      inside, followed by the landlord. The smaller man, his hands and arms
      laden with shawls and wraps, gesticulated for an instant as if giving
      orders to the two chauffeurs, waited until both machines had backed away,
      and entered the open door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who do you think the big man is, Mac?&rdquo; Lonnegan asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know, and don&rsquo;t want to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lambert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Saw Logs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same, and&mdash;yes&mdash;by Jove! That little fellow with the wraps
      is Tommy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A moment later Tommy reappeared and made straight for the barmaid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get me some crushed ice and vermouth,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We carry our Hollands
      with us. Why, Mr. MacWhirter! and Mr. Lonnegan! and&mdash;&rdquo; (I was the
      &ldquo;and&rdquo;&mdash;but he seemed to have forgotten my name.) &ldquo;Well, this <i>is</i>
      a surprise!&rdquo; Neither the mill-owner nor the curate came within range of
      his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where have I been? Well, I&rsquo;ll have to think. We did London for a week&mdash;Savoy
      for supper&mdash;Prince&rsquo;s for luncheon&mdash;theatre every night&mdash;that
      sort of thing. Picked up a couple of Gainsboroughs at Agnew&rsquo;s and some
      tapestries belonging to Lord&mdash;forget his name&mdash;had a letter.&rdquo;
       (Here Tommy fumbled in his pocket.) &ldquo;No, I remember now, I gave it to Sam.
      Then we motored to Ravenstock&mdash;looked over the Duke&rsquo;s stables&mdash;spent
      the night with a very decent chap Sam met in the Rockies last year-son of
      Lord Wingfall, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ice was ready now (it was hived in a keg and hidden in the cellar, and
      took time to get at), and so was the vermouth and the glasses, all on a
      tray.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll carry it.&rdquo; This to the barmaid, who wanted to call a waiter. &ldquo;I
      never let anybody attend to this for Sam but myself&rdquo;&mdash;this to us.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back in a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a few moments he returned, picking up the thread of his discourse with:
      &ldquo;Where was I? Oh, yes, at Lord Wingfall&rsquo;s son&rsquo;s. Well, that&rsquo;s about all.
      We are on our way now to spend a few days with&mdash;&rdquo; Here he glanced at
      the curate and the mill-owner, who were absorbing every word that fell
      from his lips. &ldquo;Some of the gentry in the next county&mdash;can&rsquo;t think of
      their names&mdash;friends of Sam.&rdquo; It became evident now that neither Mac
      nor Lonnegan intended introducing him to either of the Englishmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The barmaid pushed a second tray over the counter, and Tommy drew up a
      chair and waved us into three others. &ldquo;Sam is so helpless, you know,&rdquo; he
      chatted on. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t leave him, really, for an hour. Depends on me for
      everything. Funny, isn&rsquo;t it, that a man worth&mdash;well, anywhere from
      forty to fifty millions of dollars, and made it all himself&mdash;should
      be that way? But it&rsquo;s a fact. Very simple man, too, in his tastes, when
      you know him. Mrs. Lambert and Rosie&rdquo; (Mac stole a look at Lonnegan at the
      familiar use of the last name, but Tommy flowed on) &ldquo;got tired of the <i>Cynthia</i>&mdash;she&rsquo;s
      a hundred and ninety feet over all, sixteen knots, and cost a quarter of a
      million&mdash;and wanted Sam to get something bigger. But the old man held
      out; wanted to know what I thought of it, and, of course, I had to say she
      was all right, and that settled it. Just the same way with that new house
      on the Avenue&mdash;you know it, Mr. Lonnegan&mdash;after he&rsquo;d spent one
      hundred and fifty thousand dollars decorating the music-room&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      the one facing the Avenue&mdash;she thought she&rsquo;d change it to
      Louis-Seize. Of course Sam didn&rsquo;t care for the money, but it was the dirt
      and plaster and discomfort of it all. By the way, after dinner, suppose
      you and Mr. Lonnegan, and you, too&rdquo;&mdash;this to me&mdash;&ldquo;come in and
      have a cigar with Sam. We&rsquo;ve got some good Reina Victorias especially made
      for him&mdash;glad to have you know him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mac gazed out of the open door and shut his teeth tight. Lonnegan looked
      down into the custard-pie face of the speaker, but made no reply. Tommy
      laid a coin on the counter, shot out his cuffs, said: &ldquo;See you later,&rdquo; and
      sauntered out.
    </p>
    <p>
      No! There were no buds or blossoms&mdash;nothing of any kind, for that
      matter&mdash;out of Tommy&rsquo;s reach!
    </p>
    <p>
      The mill-owner rose to his feet, straightened his square shoulders, made a
      movement as if to speak, altered his mind, shook Mac&rsquo;s hand warmly, and
      with a bow to the tap-room, and a special nod to the barmaid, mounted his
      horse and rode off. The curate looked up and smiled, his gaze riveted on
      Mac.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of your American gentlemen, sir?&rdquo; he asked. The tone was most
      respectful&mdash;not a trace of sarcasm, not a line visible about the
      corners of his mouth; only the gray eyes twinkled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Mac grimly; &ldquo;<i>a gentleman&rsquo;s gentleman</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next morning at sunrise Mac burst into our room roaring with laughter,
      slapping his pajama-incased knee with his fat hand, the tears streaming
      from his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve gone!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Scooted! Saw Logs, Mrs. Saw, the piece of
      kindling and her maid in the first car, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was doubled up like a jack-knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And left Tommy behind!&rdquo; we both cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Behind!&rdquo; Mac was verging on apoplexy now. &ldquo;Behind! Not much. He was
      tucked away in the other car with the valet!&rdquo;
